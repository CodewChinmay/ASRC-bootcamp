        <h1>About ASRC</h1>
        <p>ASRC Bootcamp was formed by four friends with a shared love for coding and technology: Akshay Satpute, Shreyash Pohokar, Rahul Chavan, and Chinmay Ingale. What started as simple discussions about tech has now evolved into a collaborative platform for learning and growth. We focus on programming, software development, and tech innovations while building real-world projects to hone our skills. Through collaboration and community-driven learning, we aim to empower each other and the wider tech community.</p>
        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>ASRC isn't just about technology – it's about community. We’re here to support each other, share knowledge, and have fun while doing it. Our mission is to grow as developers and individuals, learning together and pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve.</p>
